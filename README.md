# Indonesia Cup Of Excellence

Cup of Excellence (COE) is a prestigious competition in the coffee industry that seeks to find and recognize the highest quality coffees from around the world. It’s like the Oscars for coffee! Here’s how it works:

- **Finding the Best Beans**: Coffee farmers from different regions submit their best coffee beans to the competition. These beans are carefully grown and processed to ensure they have the most delicious flavors.
- **Expert Judging**: A panel of expert coffee tasters, also known as cuppers, evaluates each batch of beans. They use their finely-tuned taste buds to assess factors like flavor, aroma, acidity, and body.
- **Scoring The Best Coffees**: These coffees have each been cupped a minimum of five different times during the cupping process. The coffees that scored above 87 are categorized in the Cup Of Excellence list. These are the cream of the crop, the absolute best coffees that stand out for their exceptional quality and unique flavors.
- **Worldwide Open Auction**: Buyers around the world compete for the honor to owning and selling these unique coffees to their customers. These auctions have set the standard for the increased premiums that farmers have been able to receive for their exemplary coffees and have set the standard for transparency in pricing.
- **Promoting Excellence**: Cup of Excellence doesn’t just celebrate great coffee; it also helps to promote sustainable practices and fair treatment of coffee farmers. By highlighting the best coffees, the competition encourages farmers to strive for excellence and rewards them for their hard work.

Cup of Excellence is essentially a celebration of the skill and commitment that go into making exceptional coffee. It draws attention to the skilled growers and producers who are committed to providing coffee enthusiasts all over the world with extraordinary coffee experiences.

## The Project's Steps.

### 1. Web Scraping from the Official Website

All the data, including the historical COE results per country per year, is published on their official website: https://allianceforcoffeeexcellence.org/competition-auction-results/

I do the web scraping with Python, using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. The detailed code can be checked at this link: [Web Scraping Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ON7HYpzdF-IZH_Sd9N9YjrgDWX1NoQxg?usp=sharing&source=post_page-----c17811366a33--------------------------------)
